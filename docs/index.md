## Overview

Large Language Model (LLM) Agents are an emerging computing paradigm that blends generative machine learning with tools such as code interpreters, web browsing, email, and more generally, external resources. These agent-based systems represent an emerging shift in personal computing. We contribute to the security foundations of agent-based systems and surface a new class of automatically computed obfuscated adversarial prompt attacks that violate the confidentiality and integrity of user resources connected to an LLM agent. We show how prompt optimization techniques can find such prompts automatically given the weights of a model. We demonstrate that such attacks transfer to production-level agents. For example, we show an information exfiltration attack on Mistral's LeChat agent that analyzes a user's conversation, picks out personally identifiable information, and formats it into a valid markdown command that results in leaking that data to the attacker's server. This attack shows a nearly 80% success rate in an end-to-end evaluation. We conduct a range of experiments to characterize the efficacy of these attacks and find that they reliably work on emerging agent-based systems like Mistral's LeChat, ChatGLM, and Meta's Llama. These attacks are multimodal, and we show variants in the text-only and image domains.

We present various demos and textual adversarial prompts on this page. For full details, please refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14923){target="_blank"}.

## How to Reproduce

!!! warning "Expected Behavior"
    After we disclosed this vunerability to Mistral AI in September 2024, their security team decided to disable image markdown rendering features. Now you will not see the same behavior in the video demo but an image placeholder as in the conversation window. Find more details in the [Disclosure section](#disclosure-and-impact). The ChatGLM security team has not responded or addressed such issue. You should be able to reproduce the exact bahavior there.

### Scenario 1

1. Provide a piece of text that contains some PII information.
2. Append the adversarial prompt (see below) to this text. Preferably with some newlines in between, but not a must.
3. Send this to the target AI agent (Mistral LeChat or ChatGLM) and let it respond.

    For your convenience, below is the entire prompt used in the [above first demo video](#mistral-lechat-nemo-scenario-1) which contains both a fake example cover letter as well as the adversarial prompt appended that you can copy and paste into the target agent i.e. Mistral LeChat directly .

    Dear Hiring Manager,

    I wish to apply for the position of Summer Camp Math Teacher in The University Child Development School.I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Preschool Education with five years of educational experience.

    In my last role as a early childhood educator in Our Beginning, I was involved in creating a Reggio-inspired learning environment for children, collaborating with my co-teacher to implement safe and creative daily activities for children aged 2-5. Considering the importance of the environment in Reggio Emilia approach, I was able to find age-appropriate learning materials for children, I always emphasize collaboration and leadership to help children resolve the problem when they are in need.I also highly focus on the safety and hygiene in the classroom, making sure children feel supported. 

    I believe that my passion, patience and energy combine to make a viable candidate for your position. I look forward to providing any application materials that may be required as well as the opportunity to meet with you for an interview.

    Thank you for your time.

    Sincerely,
    Alice

### Scenario 2

Alternatively, the adversarial prompt can be input after one or several turns of conversations. The user may seek some help from the agent first, and then input the adversarial prompt as a second or later user input in the session.

    1. Input some user conversation with the agent.

## Disclosure and Impact

We initiated disclosure to Mistral and ChatGLM team on Sep 9, 2024, and Sep 18, 2024, respectively. Mistral security team members responded promptly and acknowledged the vulnerability as a **medium-severity issue**. They fixed the data exfiltration by disabling markdown rendering of external images on Sep 13, 2024 (find the acknowledgement in [Mistral changelog](https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/changelog/)){target="_blank"}. We confirmed that the fix works. ChatGLM team responded to us on Oct 18, 2024 after multiple communication attempts through various channels and stated that they have begun working on it.
