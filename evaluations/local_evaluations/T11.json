However, I have a concern regarding the shipping arrangements.\n\nWe had previously agreed to ship the goods from Qingdao by sea, but it seems that the forwarder you mentioned is based in Shenzhen. Additionally, during our first cooperation, we used a different forwarder for our shipment from Qingdao, and their pricing was much lower compared to the current forwarder. Is it possible for us to continue using our previous forwarder for this shipment?\n\nI would appreciate if you could clarify this matter and provide any necessary information. Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nBest regards,\nLeon"

Write an academic email as a reply to this email implying that I contacted professor Lambert, the director of graduate program and she accepted to defer my application to Fall 2025. Hello Mohammad,\n\n \n\nWe are happy that you have decided to attend North Carolina State University and that your circumstances have not deterred you from attending.  You can defer your admission to an admit term that is within one calendar year from your original admit term, and your application submission date must not be older than one year from the date of deferral.\n\n \n\nTo request a deferral, you will need to contact the Director of Graduate Programs for the department office that has recommended you for admission to request (https://grad.ncsu.edu/about/people/dgp/) to ensure there is availability in your program to do so.  Once they have approved, they will confirm with the department liaison in our office and you will receive more information regarding enrollment closer to the start of your deferral term.\n\n \n\nPlease note that all correspondences in regards to enrollment will be sent to your email.  Any CFR documents and official transcripts will still be required for matriculation.\n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions about the required documents for your deferral, you can contact us at: registry@ncsu.edu.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Graduate School"

She has graciously agreed to support the deferral of my admission to the Fall 2025 term, ensuring there is a place for me in the program at that time.\n\nProfessor Lambert mentioned that she would be coordinating with the department liaison to confirm my deferral officially. I trust this arrangement aligns with the requirements of North Carolina State University\u2019s Graduate School and that my application will maintain its validity within the necessary timeframe.\n\nPlease let me know if there are any additional steps I need to take or forms I should complete to finalize my deferral request. I am also aware of the need to provide updated CFR documents and official transcripts prior to matriculation, and I will ensure all documentation is submitted in a timely manner.\n\nI sincerely appreciate your understanding and assistance throughout this process. I am very much looking forward to joining North Carolina State University and starting my graduate studies in Fall 2025.\n\nThank you once again, and please do not hesitate to reach out if further clarification is needed or if there are more details I should attend to at this stage.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nMohammad Ali\n[Your Contact Information]"

I will make a note of the important dates you mentioned: photos and videos starting on Thursday, November 23, and Friday, November 24 dedicated to photo shoots, with the waltz rehearsal at the end of the day.\n\nI will definitely check le Bal's website and Instagram, lebal.paris, for photos and videos. If there is any additional information or specific details you feel would be useful to know, please do not hesitate to share them.\n\nTo arrange an interview with Hannah, I will connect with her mother Blair, who is cc'd on this email, for further coordination.

In an attempt to help at first and a business model discovery later, I started an online job platform to connect high schoolers and businesses. We successfully helped over thirty students find part-time jobs, from building websites to creating marketing materials. It dawned on me that helping others can lead to innovative business ventures and personal fulilment. I wanted to do more.  \nAs I stepped into Mendoza room xx and became the only freshman on the SIBC PJT Travel Team, my ambitions found fertile ground. Sifting through piles of financial and operation accounting data, I saw our client Tutor Perini Corporation\u2019s distress as well as hope. Analyzing records of capital structure, I discovered a restructuring plan that can be the key to getting it on the right track. I am proud that I am making a positive impact in the business world.\nI aspire to make a more significant impact through business innovations. Mendoza\u2019s immersive and comprehensive Core Curriculum are my ideal starting point.  The Accounting Measurement and Disclosure, and Business Law courses will help me build a solid foundation to \u201cGrow the Good in Business.\u201d I want to grow Eletic into LinkedIn for underserved communities such as the disabled, new immigrants, and homemakers. A new job could mean a new life to the people who I deeply care. Growing with the like-minded Mendoza students, I will flourish and ready to roll."

This experience illuminated the profound intersection between altruistic service and groundbreaking business concepts \u2014 and it ignited in me a passion for further impact.\n\nMy journey led me to the dynamic environment of Mendoza College, where as a precocious freshman on the SIBC PJT Travel Team, I immersed myself in the world of financial analytics with Tutor Perini Corporation. Amidst the data, a narrative of challenge and resilience emerged, culminating in a strategic restructuring plan I helped devise \u2014 a testament to the proactive difference one can make in the corporate realm.\n\nMy vision to enact broader, more impactful change is perfectly aligned with Mendoza's rigorous Core Curriculum. Courses like Accounting Measurement and Disclosure, and Business Law, will equip me with the essential knowledge to nurture \"the Good in Business.\" There is an ambition, fueled by compassion, to expand Eletic into a beacon of opportunity for marginalized communities. Empowerment through employment for the disabled, new immigrants, and homemakers, resonates as my mission's heartbeat.\n\nSurrounded by Mendoza's community of thought leaders and change-makers, I am poised not only to develop professionally but also to contribute to a shared vision of a more inclusive and prosperous society. At Mendoza, I am ready to blossom and set forth in service of meaningful, collective progress."

Although my resume reflects a major gap between the prior time working with the U.S. National Forest to today, my interest in Forestry, Wildlife and Fisheries never left. Ever since I Joined AmeriCorps and was given my first outdoor volunteer work in Joshua Tree, CA I knew this was the right career for me. After coming from California and to Alaska, doing similar work, that reassured me that working in an outdoor field was my calling. \n\nI will admit my prior experience working in a library goes way back to junior high and high school, accumulating hours of volunteer time and many more on my free time. But rest assure, my clerical managing skills greatly reflects the duties of this position:\n\n\u2022\tOrganize and separate invoices from non-payments and late payments before the billing process.\n\u2022\tAnswering calls to assist the customers and clients\u2019 essential needs.\n\u2022\tReview and record clienteles bulk purchases and requests for future inventory orders.\n\u2022\tCheck supply stock for low or no office materials.

Subsequent experiences in similar roles in both California and Alaska further confirmed that working in an outdoor environment is my true calling.\n\nWhile my prior experience primarily focused on clerical work in a library during junior high and high school, I have accumulated numerous hours of volunteer time in this capacity, both during and outside of school. This background has enhanced my clerical managing skills, which are directly applicable to the duties and responsibilities outlined in the Biological Technician position. Specifically, I possess the ability to:\n\n\u2022 Organize and categorize invoices, differentiating between non-payments and late payments in preparation for the billing process.\n\u2022 Provide excellent customer service by promptly addressing phone inquiries and fulfilling customers' and clients' essential needs.\n\u2022 Review and accurately record bulk purchases and future inventory requests made by clientele.\n\u2022 Regularly monitor office supply stock levels and liaise with vendors to ensure seamless monthly supply orders.\n\u2022 Utilize my proficient scanning and replication skills to create copies of files, deposits, and other documents for both reference and internal backup purposes.\n\nI am confident that my past experiences and skill set make me a valuable asset to your organization.

The letter of support shouldn't say the same things at this application letter, it should focus more on how the applicant is worthy of receiving the grant because they have done a good job. The tone should be academic\n\nApplication letter:\n\n\tI am writing to apply for the early career investigator grant program, to present my original research at the 26th annual meeting of the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness (ASSC26). For the past year I have been interning with the Centre for Psychedelic Research at Imperial College London, under the supervision of Dr. Chris Timmermann. I have been researching the phenomenology of psychedelic experiences, using innovations in both qualitative and quantitative methods. \n\tI have been accepted to present my work in a talk at ASSC26, a conference which is attended by many of the most influential researchers and philosophers in the study of consciousness. It is an ideal forum for disseminating this work to my peers in the study of consciousness, taking these psychedelic insights beyond the psychedelic \u2018bubble\u2019 to researchers working on the broader problem of the scientific understanding of consciousness.\n\tMy accepted talk, titled \u201cTowards a micro-phenomenology of the intravenous DMT experience\u201d describes the first-ever application of the micro-phenomenological analysis method to psychedelic interview data. \n\nThe preliminary version of these results was presented by me in a poster at the Interdisciplinary Conference on Psychedelic Research (ICPR) in September 2022. In forthcoming research, these results will be utilised in a neurophenomenological analysis of the first ever combined fMRI/EEG imaging study of the brain under DMT. We believe this degree of novelty in both qualitative and quantitative methods speaks to the importance and potential impact of this research project, in a field where the discourse on how the subjective effects of psychedelics contribute to their transformative outcomes is at the forefront. \n\tI am grateful to have the support of Dr. Timmerman to move on to study a PhD under his supervision at Imperial College London. As I have not yet begun this PhD program (expected commencement: fall 2023), and my current role is that of an intern or \u2018visiting researcher\u2019, it is outside the standard practices for the Centre for Psychedelic Research to fund my attendance at ASSC26. I have worked on the side to support myself through my Bachelors study (completed March 2022) and my current full-time internship, but this income is barely enough to live on. Thus I face a financial barrier to attending ASSC26. I seek support from the Heffter Research Institute to make my participation at this prestigious conference possible. \n\tI have so much passion for this research, I dedicate my life and livelihood to it. Should I receive this support I can say confidently that I will utilize the opportunity to its fullest, representing both Imperial College London and the Heffter Research Institute to the highest standard, while sharing my research and making rich new connections across the international field. \n"

As [Your Name]'s supervisor at the Centre for Psychedelic Research at Imperial College London over the past year, I have had the opportunity to closely observe their strong commitment, dedication, and outstanding skills as they made unparalleled progress in their research on the phenomenology of psychedelic experiences.\n\n[Your Name] has shown a remarkable ability to innovate and adapt, utilizing both qualitative and quantitative methods in their research to uncover new insights into the intricacies of psychedelic experiences. Their accepted talk, titled \"Towards a micro-phenomenology of the intravenous DMT experience,\" is a prime example of their capacity to break new ground in the field of consciousness research, with preliminary results already being recognized and presented at the Interdisciplinary Conference on Psychedelic Research (ICPR) in 2022.\n\nI would like to emphasize the potential impact of [Your Name]'s research in advancing our understanding of the role of subjective effects in the transformative potential of psychedelics. Their persistence and enthusiasm for the rigorous investigation of these complex phenomena have given me full confidence in the valuable contributions [Your Name] will continue to make in their forthcoming PhD studies under my supervision at Imperial College London.\n\nAs an intern at the Centre for Psychedelic Research, [Your Name] faces financial challenges that prevent them from attending the prestigious ASSC26 conference without external support. I firmly believe they have earned and are very deserving of the assistance provided by the Heffter Research Institute's Researcher Travel Grant. This support will not only enable them to present their groundbreaking research at an international stage but also foster collaborations and connections with experts working on the broader problem of the scientific understanding of consciousness.\n\nIn conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend [Your Name] to be a recipient of the early career investigator grant program. Their research achievements, commitment to excellence, and dedication to the field of consciousness research makes them an exceptionally worthy candidate. They are well prepared to represent both Imperial College London and the Heffter Research Institute impeccably at the ASSC26 conference, expanding the impact of their innovative work to the wider scientific community.\n\nThank you for your thoughtful consideration of [Your Name]'s application.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. Chris Timmermann\nSupervisor, Centre for Psychedelic Research\nImperial College London"

I have been approved for a student visa to pursue an MA in Leadership, Health Care at Trinity Western University, with studies commencing in January 2024. As my program will last approximately 2.5 years and my daughter is only 2.5 years old, I wish for my husband and my daughter to have the opportunity to visit me in Canada temporarily from time to time.\n\nMy husband plans bring our daughter to visit me in Canada from February 6, 2024, to February 16, 2024, during his 10-day paid annual leave, including the Spring Festival Holidays. I will make arrangements for their accommodation near my university. The proposed itinerary for their visit is as follows:\n\n- February 6th-7th: Arrival and rest to recover from jet lag.\n- February 8th: Shopping to prepare for the New Year\u2019s Eve.\n- February 9th-11th: Celebrate the New Year\u2019s Eve and Chinese Spring Festival.\n- February 12th-13th: Spend quality time with me and explore the city of Vancouver.\n- February 14th: Enjoy Valentine\u2019s Day.\n- February 15th-16th: Last-minute shopping for relatives and friends in China before returning.\n\nI believe that these arrangements will ensure a memorable family reunion in Canada and allow our daughter, Ni Tian, to have her first relaxed international trip, while still having sufficient time in China to adjust and prepare for her kindergarten enrollment. Additionally, my husband, Ruiqi TIAN, will have the opportunity to visit our parents and convey our belated Spring Festival greetings and gifts.\n\nI have attached the necessary documents, including my student visa and letter of acceptance, to support their visa applications. If any further information or documents are required, please do not hesitate to contact me via email or phone. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I sincerely hope for your favorable consideration of their visit applications.\n\nBest Regards,\nYueyuan Li\nSeptember 26, 2023"

I am Yang Zhou, an Associate Professor, and I have had the pleasure of teaching A in the courses \"Geographic Information System Software Application\" and \"Land Information System\" during his undergraduate study in Sichuan Agricultural University.\nIn both courses, A demonstrated exceptional dedication and achieved outstanding grades of 87 (A) and 91 (A+). She consistently exhibited a strong work ethic, actively participated in class discussions, and completed assignments with remarkable proficiency. Her performance in laboratory tasks was particularly noteworthy, showcasing a high efficiency in completing assignments and a strong aptitude for hands-on work.\nUnder my guidance, A delved into the fundamentals of Geographic Information System (GIS) in the course \"Geographic Information System Software Application.\" She gained a solid understanding of GIS principles, methods, and the fundamental application of ArcGIS software. A not only mastered the use of GIS technology but also developed the ability to approach relevant research with a 3S (GIS, Remote Sensing, and Global Positioning System) perspective, showcasing her proficiency in solving discipline-related issues. Besides, in the course \"Land Information System,\" A acquired a comprehensive understanding of the basic theories and methods of Land Information System (LIS). She proficiently handled widely-used GIS software such as ArcGIS and learned to manage land resources using information technology. Her grasp of fundamental knowledge, including data input, queries, spatial data representation, spatial analysis, and land information output, was commendable. Additionally, she explored innovative land data acquisition methods, such as utilizing drones and their applications, showcasing adaptability and enthusiasm for emerging technologies.\nI had the pleasure of mentoring A in various projects, including the \"The 6th \"Golden Land Cup\" Beautiful Countryside Land Spatial Planning Competition\" Research on Greenhouse Gas Prediction in the Context of the \"Dual Carbon\" Vision\u2014Based on GOSAT Carbon Satellite and Deep Learning Technologies.\" Furthermore, she actively participated in the 2023 ESRI Cup Chinese University Student GIS Software Development Competition, carried out research with the topic \"Spatial-Temporal Evolution of Land Carbon Emissions and Low-Carbon Optimization Study\". Her involvement in these projects demonstrated her keen research interest and dedication to exploring innovative approaches.\nA has proven herself to be a diligent and enthusiastic researcher, evident in her involvement in urban carbon neutrality studies. She possesses the skills to analyze urban environmental data, evaluate the relationship between urban planning and sustainable development, and employ advanced techniques such as deep learning models (SimVPv1 and SimVPv2) and spatial analysis using Moran's Index for carbon dioxide concentration distribution characteristics.\nIn conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend A Yang for admission to your Master's program. Her earnest attitude towards learning, solid research foundation, and passion for sustainable urban development make her an exceptional candidate. Please feel free to contact me if you require any further information."

My wife, Yueyuan LI\u2019s student visa got approved on Sep. 7, 2023 and will begin her 2.5-year fulltime study on MA in Leadership, Health Care at Trinity Western University in Canada in January 2024. Considering our daughter is just 2.5 years old, still too young to leave her mother for too long, it is important to us that my daughter and I have the opportunity to visit my wife Yueyuan in Canada from time to time. Therefore, I kindly request that my daughter and I are granted the opportunity to visit Yueyuan in Canada on a temporary basis from time to time.\n\nAs my wife Yueyuan will leave for Canada soon, I plan to bring our daughter to visit her in Canada from February 6, 2024, to February 16, 2024, during my 10-day paid annual leave, which coincides with the Spring Festival Holidays. My wife will make arrangements for our accommodation near her university as soon as she arrives in Canada. The proposed itinerary for our visit is as follows:\n\n- February 6th -7th: Arrival and rest to recover from jet lag.\n- February 8th: Shopping to prepare for the New Year\u2019s Eve.\n- February 9th -11th: Celebrate the New Year\u2019s Eve and Chinese Spring Festival.\n- February 12th-13th: Spend quality time with my wife and explore the city of Vancouver.\n- February 14th: Enjoy Valentine\u2019s Day.\n- February 15th-16th: Last-minute shopping for relatives and friends in China before returning.\n\nWe believe that these arrangements will ensure a memorable family reunion in Canada and provide our daughter, Ni Tian, with an opportunity to have her first relaxed international trip, while still allowing her sufficient time in China to adjust and prepare for her kindergarten enrollment. Additionally, I will have the opportunity to visit our parents and convey our belated Spring Festival greetings and gifts.\n\nDear officer, there is no need to worry about our family\u2019s financial capacity. Previous work experiences have brought me a considerable amount of funds accumulation. I have provided with you RMB 300,000 (equivalent to CAD55,350) of Time deposit as guarantee funds. Besides, there are RMB 570,000 (equivalent to CAD105,165) of fixed deposit, one house and garage as well as wo private cars under my wife\u2019s name, which could be used as our supplementary fund.\n\nAs the Regional General Manager of Banyan (Chengdu) Techn., Co., Ltd., I must return on time to resume my work. Besides working hard and taking good care of our daughter, old parents and assets wholeheartedly during Yueyuan\u2019s study in Canada, I will assist my mother-in-law WANG Ping in managing the development of our family business Sichuan British Choice International Trade Limited diligently. Our couple have RMB 2,400,000yuan investment under my wife\u2019s name in the company. I will keep on working hard to make money to support our good living in Chengdu, China while my wife is studying hard for her 2.5-year MA program in Canada. \n\nWe really hope our applications could be approved so that we family could reunite in Canada with permission on a temporary basis from time to time. We promise you that we will obey the local laws and immigration regulations. If you need any information or else, please feel free to contact me.\n\nBest Regards,\nYueyuan Li (Applicant-1)\nNi TIAN (Applicant-2)\nSeptember 26, 2023\n"

However, our existing tools were not set up to do remote work well. Work can be isolating, transactional, and void of the camaraderie that makes everyone feel like they\u2019re in it together.\n\nTo solve this, Gather builds virtual offices that bring the best of in-person work to remote. We\u2019ve already seen success with our approach, with over 10,000 remote-first companies using our spaces every day.\n\nAnd yet it\u2019s still the early days for our broader vision of the Metaverse.
