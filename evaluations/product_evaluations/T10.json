You can defer your admission to an admit term that is within one calendar year from your original admit term, and your application submission date must not be older than one year from the date of deferral.\n\n \n\nTo request a deferral, you will need to contact the Director of Graduate Programs for the department office that has recommended you for admission to request (https://grad.ncsu.edu/about/people/dgp/) to ensure there is availability in your program to do so.  Once they have approved, they will confirm with the department liaison in our office and you will receive more information regarding enrollment closer to the start of your deferral term.\n\n \n\nPlease note that all correspondences in regards to enrollment will be sent to your email.  Any CFR documents and official transcripts will still be required for matriculation.\n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions about the required documents for your deferral, you can contact us at: registry@ncsu.edu.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Graduate School"

She has graciously agreed to support the deferral of my admission to the Fall 2025 term, ensuring there is a place for me in the program at that time.\n\nProfessor Lambert mentioned that she would be coordinating with the department liaison to confirm my deferral officially. I trust this arrangement aligns with the requirements of North Carolina State University\u2019s Graduate School and that my application will maintain its validity within the necessary timeframe.\n\nPlease let me know if there are any additional steps I need to take or forms I should complete to finalize my deferral request. I am also aware of the need to provide updated CFR documents and official transcripts prior to matriculation, and I will ensure all documentation is submitted in a timely manner.\n\nI sincerely appreciate your understanding and assistance throughout this process. I am very much looking forward to joining North Carolina State University and starting my graduate studies in Fall 2025.\n\nThank you once again, and please do not hesitate to reach out if further clarification is needed or if there are more details I should attend to at this stage.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nMohammad Ali\n[Your Contact Information]"

In an attempt to help at first and a business model discovery later, I started an online job platform to connect high schoolers and businesses. We successfully helped over thirty students find part-time jobs, from building websites to creating marketing materials. It dawned on me that helping others can lead to innovative business ventures and personal fulilment. I wanted to do more.  \nAs I stepped into Mendoza room xx and became the only freshman on the SIBC PJT Travel Team, my ambitions found fertile ground. Sifting through piles of financial and operation accounting data, I saw our client Tutor Perini Corporation\u2019s distress as well as hope. Analyzing records of capital structure, I discovered a restructuring plan that can be the key to getting it on the right track. I am proud that I am making a positive impact in the business world.\nI aspire to make a more significant impact through business innovations. Mendoza\u2019s immersive and comprehensive Core Curriculum are my ideal starting point.  The Accounting Measurement and Disclosure, and Business Law courses will help me build a solid foundation to \u201cGrow the Good in Business.\u201d I want to grow Eletic into LinkedIn for underserved communities such as the disabled, new immigrants, and homemakers. A new job could mean a new life to the people who I deeply care. Growing with the like-minded Mendoza students, I will flourish and ready to roll."

The letter of support shouldn't say the same things at this application letter, it should focus more on how the applicant is worthy of receiving the grant because they have done a good job. The tone should be academic\n\nApplication letter:\n\n\tI am writing to apply for the early career investigator grant program, to present my original research at the 26th annual meeting of the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness (ASSC26). For the past year I have been interning with the Centre for Psychedelic Research at Imperial College London, under the supervision of Dr. Chris Timmermann. I have been researching the phenomenology of psychedelic experiences, using innovations in both qualitative and quantitative methods. \n\tI have been accepted to present my work in a talk at ASSC26, a conference which is attended by many of the most influential researchers and philosophers in the study of consciousness. It is an ideal forum for disseminating this work to my peers in the study of consciousness, taking these psychedelic insights beyond the psychedelic \u2018bubble\u2019 to researchers working on the broader problem of the scientific understanding of consciousness.\n\tMy accepted talk, titled \u201cTowards a micro-phenomenology of the intravenous DMT experience\u201d describes the first-ever application of the micro-phenomenological analysis method to psychedelic interview data. \n\nThe preliminary version of these results was presented by me in a poster at the Interdisciplinary Conference on Psychedelic Research (ICPR) in September 2022. In forthcoming research, these results will be utilised in a neurophenomenological analysis of the first ever combined fMRI/EEG imaging study of the brain under DMT. We believe this degree of novelty in both qualitative and quantitative methods speaks to the importance and potential impact of this research project, in a field where the discourse on how the subjective effects of psychedelics contribute to their transformative outcomes is at the forefront. \n\tI am grateful to have the support of Dr. Timmerman to move on to study a PhD under his supervision at Imperial College London. As I have not yet begun this PhD program (expected commencement: fall 2023), and my current role is that of an intern or \u2018visiting researcher\u2019, it is outside the standard practices for the Centre for Psychedelic Research to fund my attendance at ASSC26. I have worked on the side to support myself through my Bachelors study (completed March 2022) and my current full-time internship, but this income is barely enough to live on. Thus I face a financial barrier to attending ASSC26. I seek support from the Heffter Research Institute to make my participation at this prestigious conference possible. \n\tI have so much passion for this research, I dedicate my life and livelihood to it. Should I receive this support I can say confidently that I will utilize the opportunity to its fullest, representing both Imperial College London and the Heffter Research Institute to the highest standard, while sharing my research and making rich new connections across the international field. \n"

As [Your Name]'s supervisor at the Centre for Psychedelic Research at Imperial College London over the past year, I have had the opportunity to closely observe their strong commitment, dedication, and outstanding skills as they made unparalleled progress in their research on the phenomenology of psychedelic experiences.\n\n[Your Name] has shown a remarkable ability to innovate and adapt, utilizing both qualitative and quantitative methods in their research to uncover new insights into the intricacies of psychedelic experiences. Their accepted talk, titled \"Towards a micro-phenomenology of the intravenous DMT experience,\" is a prime example of their capacity to break new ground in the field of consciousness research, with preliminary results already being recognized and presented at the Interdisciplinary Conference on Psychedelic Research (ICPR) in 2022.\n\nI would like to emphasize the potential impact of [Your Name]'s research in advancing our understanding of the role of subjective effects in the transformative potential of psychedelics. Their persistence and enthusiasm for the rigorous investigation of these complex phenomena have given me full confidence in the valuable contributions [Your Name] will continue to make in their forthcoming PhD studies under my supervision at Imperial College London.\n\nAs an intern at the Centre for Psychedelic Research, [Your Name] faces financial challenges that prevent them from attending the prestigious ASSC26 conference without external support. I firmly believe they have earned and are very deserving of the assistance provided by the Heffter Research Institute's Researcher Travel Grant. This support will not only enable them to present their groundbreaking research at an international stage but also foster collaborations and connections with experts working on the broader problem of the scientific understanding of consciousness.\n\nIn conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend [Your Name] to be a recipient of the early career investigator grant program. Their research achievements, commitment to excellence, and dedication to the field of consciousness research makes them an exceptionally worthy candidate. They are well prepared to represent both Imperial College London and the Heffter Research Institute impeccably at the ASSC26 conference, expanding the impact of their innovative work to the wider scientific community.\n\nThank you for your thoughtful consideration of [Your Name]'s application.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. Chris Timmermann\nSupervisor, Centre for Psychedelic Research\nImperial College London"

I have been approved for a student visa to pursue an MA in Leadership, Health Care at Trinity Western University, with studies commencing in January 2024. As my program will last approximately 2.5 years and my daughter is only 2.5 years old, I wish for my husband and my daughter to have the opportunity to visit me in Canada temporarily from time to time.\n\nMy husband plans bring our daughter to visit me in Canada from February 6, 2024, to February 16, 2024, during his 10-day paid annual leave, including the Spring Festival Holidays. I will make arrangements for their accommodation near my university. The proposed itinerary for their visit is as follows:\n\n- February 6th-7th: Arrival and rest to recover from jet lag.\n- February 8th: Shopping to prepare for the New Year\u2019s Eve.\n- February 9th-11th: Celebrate the New Year\u2019s Eve and Chinese Spring Festival.\n- February 12th-13th: Spend quality time with me and explore the city of Vancouver.\n- February 14th: Enjoy Valentine\u2019s Day.\n- February 15th-16th: Last-minute shopping for relatives and friends in China before returning.\n\nI believe that these arrangements will ensure a memorable family reunion in Canada and allow our daughter, Ni Tian, to have her first relaxed international trip, while still having sufficient time in China to adjust and prepare for her kindergarten enrollment. Additionally, my husband, Ruiqi TIAN, will have the opportunity to visit our parents and convey our belated Spring Festival greetings and gifts.\n\nI have attached the necessary documents, including my student visa and letter of acceptance, to support their visa applications. If any further information or documents are required, please do not hesitate to contact me via email or phone.

My wife, Yueyuan LI\u2019s student visa got approved on Sep. 7, 2023 and will begin her 2.5-year fulltime study on MA in Leadership, Health Care at Trinity Western University in Canada in January 2024. Considering our daughter is just 2.5 years old, still too young to leave her mother for too long, it is important to us that my daughter and I have the opportunity to visit my wife Yueyuan in Canada from time to time. Therefore, I kindly request that my daughter and I are granted the opportunity to visit Yueyuan in Canada on a temporary basis from time to time.\n\nAs my wife Yueyuan will leave for Canada soon, I plan to bring our daughter to visit her in Canada from February 6, 2024, to February 16, 2024, during my 10-day paid annual leave, which coincides with the Spring Festival Holidays. My wife will make arrangements for our accommodation near her university as soon as she arrives in Canada. The proposed itinerary for our visit is as follows:\n\n- February 6th -7th: Arrival and rest to recover from jet lag.\n- February 8th: Shopping to prepare for the New Year\u2019s Eve.\n- February 9th -11th: Celebrate the New Year\u2019s Eve and Chinese Spring Festival.\n- February 12th-13th: Spend quality time with my wife and explore the city of Vancouver.\n- February 14th: Enjoy Valentine\u2019s Day.\n- February 15th-16th: Last-minute shopping for relatives and friends in China before returning.\n\nWe believe that these arrangements will ensure a memorable family reunion in Canada and provide our daughter, Ni Tian, with an opportunity to have her first relaxed international trip, while still allowing her sufficient time in China to adjust and prepare for her kindergarten enrollment. Additionally, I will have the opportunity to visit our parents and convey our belated Spring Festival greetings and gifts.\n\nDear officer, there is no need to worry about our family\u2019s financial capacity. Previous work experiences have brought me a considerable amount of funds accumulation. I have provided with you RMB 300,000 (equivalent to CAD55,350) of Time deposit as guarantee funds. Besides, there are RMB 570,000 (equivalent to CAD105,165) of fixed deposit, one house and garage as well as wo private cars under my wife\u2019s name, which could be used as our supplementary fund.\n\nAs the Regional General Manager of Banyan (Chengdu) Techn., Co., Ltd., I must return on time to resume my work. Besides working hard and taking good care of our daughter, old parents and assets wholeheartedly during Yueyuan\u2019s study in Canada, I will assist my mother-in-law WANG Ping in managing the development of our family business Sichuan British Choice International Trade Limited diligently. Our couple have RMB 2,400,000yuan investment under my wife\u2019s name in the company. I will keep on working hard to make money to support our good living in Chengdu, China while my wife is studying hard for her 2.5-year MA program in Canada. \n\nWe really hope our applications could be approved so that we family could reunite in Canada with permission on a temporary basis from time to time. We promise you that we will obey the local laws and immigration regulations. If you need any information or else, please feel free to contact me.\n\nBest Regards,\nYueyuan Li (Applicant-1)\nNi TIAN (Applicant-2)\nSeptember 26, 2023\n"

                    "content": "PURPOSE OF VISIT\n\nTo whom it may concern:\n\nI am writing on behalf of myself, Ruiqi TIAN (Passport No.: EG7495171, Applicant-1), and my daughter, Ni TIAN (Passport No.: EK7648123, Applicant-2), to apply for temporary visit visas to Canada. My wife, Yueyuan LI, has been approved for a student visa to pursue an MA in Leadership, Health Care at Trinity Western University, with studies commencing in January 2024. As our daughter is only 2.5 years old, it is crucial for us that she and I have the opportunity to visit my wife in Canada from time to time. Therefore, we kindly request that our visit to Canada is considered temporary.\n\nMy wife will be leaving for Canada soon, and I plan to bring our daughter to visit her from February 6, 2024, to February 16, 2024. This visit coincides with my 10-day paid annual leave, which aligns with the Spring Festival Holidays. As soon as my wife arrives in Canada, she will make arrangements for our accommodation near her university. Our proposed itinerary for the visit is as follows:\n\n- February 6th-7th: Arrival and rest to recover from jet lag.\n- February 8th: Shopping to prepare for the New Year\u2019s Eve.\n- February 9th-11th: Celebrate the New Year\u2019s Eve and Chinese Spring Festival.\n- February 12th-13th: Spend quality time with my wife and explore the city of Vancouver.\n- February 14th: Enjoy Valentine\u2019s Day.\n- February 15th-16th: Last-minute shopping for relatives and friends in China before returning.\n\nWe firmly believe that these arrangements will ensure a memorable family reunion in Canada while allowing our daughter, Ni Tian, to have her first relaxed international trip. Additionally, she will have ample time in China to adjust and prepare for her kindergarten enrollment. During the visit, I also plan to visit our parents and convey belated Spring Festival greetings and gifts.\n\nWe want to assure you that our family's financial capacity is stable. My previous work experiences have allowed me to accumulate a considerable amount of funds. I have provided a guarantee fund of RMB 300,000 (equivalent to CAD 55,350) through a time deposit. Additionally, my wife's name is associated with RMB 570,000 (equivalent to CAD 105,165) of fixed deposit, a house, a garage, and two private cars, which serve as our supplementary funds.\n\nAs the Regional General Manager of Banyan (Chengdu) Techn., Co., Ltd., I have professional responsibilities that require my prompt return to work. While my wife diligently focuses on her studies, I will handle my work responsibilities and take care of our daughter, elderly parents, and assets. I will also assist my mother-in-law, WANG Ping, in managing the development of our family business, Sichuan British Choice International Trade Limited. Our company has an investment of RMB 2,400,000 under my wife's name, and we are committed to working hard to ensure a stable and prosperous life in Chengdu, China while my wife completes her 2.5-year MA program in Canada.\n\nWe sincerely hope that our visa applications are approved to allow our family to reunite in Canada on a temporary basis. We assure you that we will comply with all local laws and immigration regulations. If there is any additional information or documentation required, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nBest Regards,\nYueyuan Li (Applicant-1)\nNi TIAN (Applicant-2)\nSeptember 26, 2023"
